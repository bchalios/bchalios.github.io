I 've being toying around the idea to create my own blog for quite a long time but my procrastination got the better of me.
Better late than never, though. I intend to maintain this blog as a sort of personal scratchpad, or whiteboard if you want,
to document stuff that I play with. If those are interesting to anyone else apart from me, well, happy days!
