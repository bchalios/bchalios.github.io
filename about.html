## About

Hey there! Welcome to my <del>online playground where I post random thoughts and ideas</del> website.

I am Babis and I 'm currently working as a control plane engineer at <a href="https://voltanet.io">Volta Networks</a>.  At Volta
we're taking advantage of the cloud in order to provide low-cost, highly scalable routing infrastructure.

Apart from my work at Volta, I am interested in any technology enabling the development, deployment or management of efficient and
scalable software. Recently, I started playing around with <a href="www.unikerenel.org">Unikernels</a>. Unikernels allow the
deployment of minimal size, secure and efficient applications. That sounds like a good fit for the cloud and embedded IoT devices,
doesn't it? :)
