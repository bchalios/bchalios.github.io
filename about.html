## About

Hey there, and welcome to my <del>online playground where I post random thoughts and ideas</del> website.

I am Babis and I 'm currently working as a post-doctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.bsc.es">Barcelona Supercomputing Center</a>.
I like to play around with various stuff, but this period I am studying runtime systems for distributed memory programming model. We are
extending <a href="https://https://pm.bsc.es/ompss-2">OmpSs-2</a> a task-based parallel programming model for SMP machines to let OmpSs
applications run transparently on a distributed memory system.

Apart from my work at BSC, I am interested in any technology enabling the development, deployment or management of efficient and scalable
software. Recently, I started playing around with <a href="www.unikerenel.org">Unikernels</a>. Unikernels allow the deployment of minimal
size, secure and efficient applications. That sounds like a good fit for the cloud and embedded IoT devices, doesn't it? :)
